# GRILL.md Format

## Structure

```md
# {Grill Context Name}

{One or two sentence description of what this grill-context is and why it exists.}

## Language

**Order**:
{A concise description of the term}
_Avoid_: Purchase, transaction

**Invoice**:
A request for payment sent to a customer after delivery.
_Avoid_: Bill, payment request

**Customer**:
A person or organization that places orders.
_Avoid_: Client, buyer, account

## Relationships

- An **Order** produces one or more **Invoices**
- An **Invoice** belongs to exactly one **Customer**

## Example dialogue

> **Dev:** "When a **Customer** places an **Order**, do we create the **Invoice** immediately?"
> **Domain expert:** "No — an **Invoice** is only generated once a **Fulfillment** is confirmed."

## Flagged ambiguities

- "account" was used to mean both **Customer** and **User** — resolved: these are distinct concepts.
```

## Rules

- **Be opinionated.** When multiple words exist for the same concept, pick the best one and list the others as aliases to avoid.
- **Flag conflicts explicitly.** If a term is used ambiguously, call it out in "Flagged ambiguities" with a clear resolution.
- **Keep definitions tight.** One sentence max. Define what it IS, not what it does.
- **Show relationships.** Use bold term names and express cardinality where obvious.
- **Only include terms specific to this project's grill-context.** General programming concepts (timeouts, error types, utility patterns) don't belong even if the project uses them extensively. Before adding a term, ask: is this a concept unique to this grill-context, or a general programming concept? Only the former belongs.
- **Group terms under subheadings** when natural clusters emerge. If all terms belong to a single cohesive area, a flat list is fine.
- **Write an example dialogue.** A conversation between a dev and a domain expert that demonstrates how the terms interact naturally and clarifies boundaries between related concepts.

## Single vs multi-grill-context repos

**Single grill-context (most repos):** One `GRILL.md` at the repo root.

**Multiple grill-contexts:** A `GRILL-MAP.md` at the repo root lists the grill-contexts, where they live, and how they relate to each other:

```md
# Grill Context Map

## Grill Context

- [Ordering](./src/ordering/GRILL.md) — receives and tracks customer orders
- [Billing](./src/billing/GRILL.md) — generates invoices and processes payments
- [Fulfillment](./src/fulfillment/GRILL.md) — manages warehouse picking and shipping

## Relationships

- **Ordering → Fulfillment**: Ordering emits `OrderPlaced` events; Fulfillment consumes them to start picking
- **Fulfillment → Billing**: Fulfillment emits `ShipmentDispatched` events; Billing consumes them to generate invoices
- **Ordering ↔ Billing**: Shared types for `CustomerId` and `Money`
```

The skill infers which structure applies:

- If `GRILL-MAP.md` exists, read it to find grill-contexts
- If only a root `GRILL.md` exists, single grill-context
- If neither exists, create a root `GRILL.md` lazily when the first term is resolved

When multiple grill-contexts exist, infer which one the current topic relates to. If unclear, ask.
